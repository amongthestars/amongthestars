Clean up CSS code.
  Could do with splitting it up into relevant .css files

Change the BtnToggle function so that you define a target state
  At the moment the function toggles and that can be unreliable

Finish the tooltip design and functionality
  Should show costs of clicking a button when you hover over it
  Might also show inflow/outflow of resources and power usage for the base

Base functionality
  Power usage needs a looping system behind it so that modules used power
  If power usage exceeds it maximum it should pick random modules to disable
  Disabled modules should have an effect on other systems which are to be implemented later on
